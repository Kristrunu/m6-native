# M6 - React Native App

This project is a React Native app. Set up using [Expo](https://expo.dev/). I created a very simple weather app, using OpenWeather API, that displays on one screen the current weather at your location.

&nbsp;

## To view the app locally (You will need a Mac and Xcode to do this)

#### Clone the app to a folder on your computer:

```
git clone
```

#### Go to the app folder:

```
cd weather-react-native
```

#### install dependencies:

```
npm install
```

or

```
yarn
```

#### Run the app:

```
npm run start
```

or

```
yarn start
```
#### You need to add .env file and contact me to get the API key to put in that file. 

#### Open localhost:19002 in your browser

#### Select "Run on IOS sumulator"

- You may need to open Xcode Simulator on your computer
